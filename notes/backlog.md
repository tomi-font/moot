- Break down `parsing/` source files.

- Extend EntityQuery::getAll() to allow specifying several component types and be able to iterate over ~tuples, allowing one element to be an Entity. (See structured bindings.)

- Update to SFML 3.0 once it's released (and fix the empty window name workaround made for libc++ 18).
